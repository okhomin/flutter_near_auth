<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This example covers the process of implementing authentication using Flutter and NEAR Protocol and validating all the data on the backend side.

> **If you're not familiar with Flutter & Golang, read these resources before following further**:
> * https://flutter.dev/
> * https://go.dev/

The Flutter client uses a NEAR wallet to add a public key to the account.  
The backend side validates the data making RPC requests to a [NEAR RPC provider](https://docs.near.org/api/rpc/providers).

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

ðŸ’¡ _Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed_

- [golang](https://go.dev/dl/)
- [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git/)

### Prerequisites

Follow these simple instructions to setup the required dependencies before usage

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/okhomin/flutter_near_auth
   ```
2. Add platform related files to the flutter project
   ```sh
   cd client && flutter create --platforms=ios,android .
   ```
   Remove ios or android if you want to use only one platform. For example:
   ```sh
   cd client && flutter create --platforms=android .
   ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

> Keep in mind you need to replace `walletUrl` and `contractId` with the `NEAR wallet` you want to use and with the `contract id` of your application in the [index.html](./backend/index.html#L9-L10) file.
```javascript
const walletUrl = 'https://wallet.testnet.near.org/';
const contractId = 'auth.coatyworld1.testnet';
```
> You need to replace `nearEndpoint` and `contractID` with the [`NEAR RPC provider`](https://docs.near.org/api/rpc/providers) you want to use and with the `contract id` of your application in the [main.go](./backend/cmd/main.go#L15-L18) file.
```go
package main

const (
	nearEndpoint = "https://rpc.testnet.near.org"
	contractID   = "auth.coatyworld1.testnet"
)
```
> You need to replace configuration constants in the Flutter client depending on your domain, path, and redirect urls in the [main.dart](./client/lib/main.dart#L112-L116) file.
```dart
static const String _backendHost = 'localhost:8080';
static const String _failureURL = 'client://failure';
static const String _successURL = 'client://success';
static const String _nearLoginPath = '/near/index.html';
static const String _backendAuthPath = '/auth';
```

### Running Backend
[`main.go`](./backend/cmd/main.go) contains the backend logic that is responsible for the validation process of the data received from the Flutter client.
Also, it contains the logic of serving the [`HTML file`](./backend/index.html) that is used for redirection to the NEAR wallet.  
The server will be available at `localhost:8080` by default. If you want to change the port, you need to change the [`main.go`](./backend/cmd/main.go#L108) file.

```sh
cd backend
go run cmd/main.go
```

### Running Flutter client
> Don't forget to generate platform related files and run the backend before running the Flutter client.

[`main.dart`](./client/lib/main.dart) contains the Flutter client logic that is responsible for the authentication process.
To run the client you must have a connected device or emulator. But you may have to replace `localhost` with your local IP address in the [`main.dart`](./client/lib/main.dart#L112) file if you want to run the client on a real device.

```sh
cd client
flutter run
```
